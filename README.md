# JEE-Mains

## WIP Notice

- This repository is a work-in-progress, the content on this repo can change very frequently. Make sure to keep up with changes on this repository.

## Introduction

1. This repository provides scripts to aid in the procedure of JEE Mains
2. Over the course of due time, Other Contributors and I will add features to this program

## CONFIG EXPLANATION

The config file contains parameters that alter the functionality of the program.

- cache mode is the way that the answer keys are fetched.
  - `online-only` fetches the answer_key every time.
  - `normal` fetches the answer key if it doesn't exist on your pc. Else uses the one already present.
  - `offline-only` only uses the answer keys saved on your pc. Raises an Exception if it doesn't exist.

- response_sheet_url contains the url to your response sheet. It usually begins with `https://cdnX.digitalm.com` etc.
- DEBUG Flag can be set to true or false depending on the level of trouble shooting you maybe doing. Default is false.

## ShiftCode Explanation

The shift code describes what partial answer key to download.
The format is `YYYY-MM-DD-S-LNG-PAPR`.

- `YYYY` is the year in 4 digits (1995)
- `MM` is the month in 2 digits (07 for July)
- `DD` is the day in 2 digits (07)
- `S` is the shift in 1 digit (M for Morning, E for evening.)
- `LNG` is the language in 3 digits (ENG for english)
- `PAPR` is the paper in 4 digits (TECH for BE/BTech, PLAN for Planning, ARCH for B.Arch, PLAR for Planning and Arch)

I am working on the Mar Attempt Answer Keys.
All February Attempt Keys are available now.
